# **Book Finder Project** 📚  
**Addressing the Tip-of-the-Tongue Phenomenon**  

---

## **Project Description**  
The **Book Finder** project is an intelligent book search system designed to help users locate books even when they only remember vague or partial details. This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, specifically **BM25** for keyword-based search and **Sentence-BERT (SBERT)** for semantic search, to provide accurate and relevant search results.  

The system features a modern, interactive **web interface** built with **Flask**, making it accessible and user-friendly. Whether users recall a book's theme, character names, or plot points, the Book Finder efficiently bridges the gap between incomplete memory and book discovery.

## **Features**  
- 🔍 **Keyword-Based Search**: BM25 for tokenized keyword matching.  
- 🤖 **Semantic Search**: SBERT for context-aware similarity-based searching.  
- 🎨 **Modern User Interface**: Responsive and interactive Flask-based UI.  
- 📊 **Dynamic Results**: Display book titles, authors, and ratings dynamically.  
- 🚀 **Scalable**: Can be extended to other domains such as movies and music.

### **1. Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:  
- Python (version 3.8 or above)  
- pip (Python package manager)  

### **2. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-finder.git
cd book-finder
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**  
Run the following command to install the required libraries:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Project Files**  
Ensure you have the following files and folder structure:  
```plaintext
project_folder/
│
├── app.py                          # Flask application  
├── books_data.pkl                  # Preprocessed book dataset with SBERT embeddings  
├── bm25_model.pkl                  # BM25 precomputed model  
├── templates/                      # HTML templates  
│   └── index.html                  # Frontend interface  
├── static/                         # Static files (CSS, images)  
│   └── style.css                   # Custom CSS for styling  
├── requirements.txt                # Project dependencies  
└── README.md                       # Project documentation  
```

### **5. Run the Application**  
Start the Flask application by running:  
```bash
python app.py
```

The app will run on your local server. Open your browser and go to:  
```plaintext
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## **How to Use the Application**  

1. **Input Your Query**:  
   - Enter keywords, themes, author names, or plot details into the search box.  

2. **Select a Search Method**:  
   - By default, the app uses **BM25** for keyword-based search.  
   - You can explore semantic search powered by **SBERT**.  

3. **View Results**:  
   - The most relevant book titles, authors, and ratings will be displayed dynamically.
